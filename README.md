# Tech Blog
Tech Blog is a content management system (CMS) style blog platform that allows developers to publish, view, and comment on technical articles. 
It is designed to facilitate the sharing of knowledge and ideas among developers. Users can sign up to create an account, log in, and then have
access to a personal dashboard where they can create new blog posts, edit or delete existing ones, and manage comments on their posts. 
The homepage showcases all existing posts, where logged-in users can leave comments to engage with the community. 
The application is deployed on Render and adheres to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm to maintain a clean and organized structure.<br><br>
